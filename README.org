* Introduction
  This project aims to be a USB-connected Flight Sim Panel.  It should work with
  both MSFS and XPlane.  I am currently basing the project on the STM32F401; I
  may consider other microprocessors.  I just happen to have this chip lying
  around.  Regardless, my USB connection shouldn't be hacked together, I want
  real hardware support for USB.

  
* Goals
  - all of the buttons needed to simulate at least a Cessna 172.
  - 6 pack flight instruments.
  - Radio controls and readout.
